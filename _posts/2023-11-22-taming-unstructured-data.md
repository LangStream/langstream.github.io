We create, disseminate, and consume information at an unprecedented volume and rate. Approximately [328 million terabytes are added to the internet every day](https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/) and the vast majority of that data is unstructured: pictures, video, audio, and written content. This wealth of information holds untold insights and vast potential for innovation, but without predefined data models or structures to enable scalable analysis, we have only tapped into a fraction of it.

[LangStream](https://docs.langstream.ai/about/what-is-langstream) is a vectorization platform focused on streaming data. It can continuously process and transform streams of unstructured information in real time, converting them into structured, vectorized formats that are immediately ready for analysis by machine learning (ML) models.

In this article, we'll explore the value of a streamlined process for handling unstructured data in generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications and the benefits of LangStream's vectorization workflow.


## The Challenge of Unstructured Data

Our sprawling digital landscape is overflowing with content in every form. A constant deluge of user-generated material is available on social media alone — status updates, blog posts, and comments. Videos and images flood multimedia platforms, telling countless stories.

The variety and volume of this unstructured data present a formidable challenge when it comes to analysis — and more companies are deploying AI tools to overcome it.

Powerful ML algorithms have given us new abilities to handle colossal datasets. However, most require structured inputs. Not only do they need structured data at the inference stage, when users prompt them to generate text, but they also need to train on massive datasets of — you guessed it — structured data.

To that end, data scientists have developed various techniques to convert unstructured data into structured data. One key method is vectorization.


## What Is Vectorization?

Vectorization is the process of converting unstructured data into numerical vectors that ML models can interpret and analyze. In the case of text data, vectorization involves converting words or phrases into vectors based on features such as their semantic meaning and frequency of occurrence. The resulting numerical vectors retain the essential information from the original data, enabling algorithms to identify patterns so they can make predictions and generate insights.

Traditional methods of transforming textual data, such as text parsing, natural language processing, and manual tagging, have limitations: a lack of scalability, low accuracy, or heavy resource requirements. Vectorization addresses many of these limitations. It bypasses the need for extensive manual tagging, as similar content is grouped in the vector space for easier searching and analysis.

Moreover, it reduces dependency on large amounts of labeled training data, as the vectors capture the semantic meaning of the content. And unlike rigid text parsing methods, vectorization is more flexible and can handle variations in the data.

In short, vectorization is a scalable method for transforming large volumes of unstructured data and a powerful tool for organizing, searching, and deriving insights from it.


## LangStream's Vectorization Workflow

LangStream has a streamlined vectorization workflow optimized for event-driven, real-time applications — especially generative AI:



1. **Data ingestion**:** **LangStream ingests unstructured textual data from various sources — social media platforms, sensors in Internet of Things (IoT) devices, or financial markets, for example.
2. **Data processing**:** **Specialized agents crawl through the ingested data. These agents access documents from diverse storage sources, segmenting and preparing the data for the next stage.
3. **Embedding and vectorization**:** **The processed data is passed through embedding models from platforms like OpenAI or Hugging Face, converting the unstructured data into numerical vectors that capture the content's semantic meaning.
4. **Syncing with vector databases**:** **The vectorized data is seamlessly integrated and stored in LangStream-compatible vector databases such as Astra DB, Milvus, or Pinecone.

Let's look deeper into how LangStream simplifies the integration and use of vectorized data in generative AI applications.


### Easy Configuration and Pipeline Setup

You can configure LangStream's runtime environment for scalability and robustness using settings like memory allocation, load balancing, and fault tolerance. With the right configuration, you can optimize your environment to remain efficient and reliable even as data volume increases. This adaptability ensures that as your usage of generative AI applications ramps up, LangStream can scale its operations to accommodate your needs.

LangStream also lets you define data pipelines through simple configurations without writing complex code. You control the whole process — from data ingestion to vectorization to storage in a vector database like Astra DB.


### Event-Driven Architecture

An event-driven architecture ensures LangStream has the most recent and relevant data available for generative AI applications. LangStream's workflow continually evaluates and updates the vectorized data to remain fresh and relevant. This capability is crucial for applications that rely on streaming data to provide accurate and timely responses, like social media analytics, financial trading platforms, and IoT devices.


### Integration with Other Technologies

Langstream works with reliable and popular technologies like Kubernetes and Apache Kafka, enabling seamless integration into existing infrastructures and robust scalability.

As mentioned, LangStream supports vector databases like Pinecone and Astra DB out of the box. This tight integration ensures that vectorized data is readily available for generative AI applications, facilitating high-quality prompt generation for LLMs.

Finally, LangStream also supports integration with popular AI and embedding models from platforms like OpenAI and Hugging Face. You can leverage the latest in AI vectorization technology, ensuring that the vectorized data is high-quality and suitable for use in generative AI applications.


### No-Code or Custom-Code

LangStream offers a no-code, configuration-based approach. Users can set up data processing and vectorization workflows without writing code from scratch. They can also compose pipelines by configuring and combining various "agents" — prebuilt components or modules designed to perform specific tasks. For example, agents can crawl websites, access documents from storage sources, segment data, and contribute to the data preparation and vectorization process.

However, for more advanced use cases, LangStream also supports custom development. Developers can write custom agents in Python, allowing for greater flexibility and the ability to address more complex or unique requirements.


## Comparing LangStream's Workflow with Traditional Vectorization Approaches

LangStream's vectorization workflow takes a novel approach to managing and processing streaming data for generative AI applications. The key ways it diverges from traditional vectorization methodologies are worth examining more closely.


### Batch Processing Versus Stream Processing

Traditional vectorization tends to rely on batch processing, where large volumes of data are collected over time and processed all at once. This approach can lead to delays in data availability and may not be suitable for applications requiring real-time insights.

LangStream, on the other hand, is purpose-built to handle streaming data. It provides real-time processing so that the most recent data is always available for generative AI applications.


### Manual Intervention Versus Simplified Data Pipelines and Automation

Traditional approaches to vectorization often require manual configuration and data wrangling, which can be time consuming and prone to human error.

With LangStream, developers define data pipelines through simple configurations, reducing the need for complex code and increasing accuracy.


### Limited Scalability Versus Robust Scalability

Depending on the implementation, traditional vectorization might not scale as efficiently as LangStream, especially when dealing with very large datasets or streaming data.

You can configure LangStream's runtime environment for scalability and robustness, ensuring it handles large volumes of streaming data efficiently. This helps you maintain performance even under high demand.


### Snapshots Versus Continuous Updates

Traditional approaches to vectorization tend not to update data continually. Unless your system regularly vectorizes data, this approach can lead to stale or outdated data in AI models, affecting their accuracy and relevance.

LangStream's event-driven architecture and continuous vectorization updates keep information fresh and relevant, which is crucial for generative AI applications that depend on up-to-the-minute data.
